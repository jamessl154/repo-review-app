### React Native
---
This part focuses on developing a mobile app using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). The end product is a GitHub repository review app. The backend is pre-built in this part and cloned from [here](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/rate-repository-api). The main advantages of React Native are that it's cross-platform and the small gap between developing web apps using React and mobile apps using React Native. It has the benefit of being compatible with all the libraries configured for React.
