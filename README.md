### React Native
---
This part focuses on mobile development using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). The end product is a GitHub repository review app where users can rate, add reviews to, sort and search for GitHub repositories. The backend is pre-built and cloned from [here](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/rate-repository-api). The main advantages of React Native are that it's cross-platform and the small gap between developing web apps using React and mobile apps using React Native. It has the benefit of being compatible with libraries built/configured for React.

We first set up a development environment with [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/), the [Expo Go](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) mobile app and the [React Native Debugger](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/debugging/#react-native-debugger). Learned React Native's [core components and APIs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis) to transition from developing in React. Built custom components e.g. ```components/Text.jsx``` that abstracted conditional styling. Passing them custom props, which default to true, changes the result of their styles array. Practiced manipulating views using [Flexbox](https://flexbox.tech/) and global theming, found in ```theme.js```. Used [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview) with [Yup](https://formik.org/docs/guides/validation) to develop dynamic SignIn, SignUp and CreateReview forms.

We then connected the app to the GraphQL version of the server and implemented manipulating and fetching repository data using [Apollo's React hooks API](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react/hooks/) that can be found in the ```hooks``` directory. Created AuthStorage class, found in ```utils/authStorage.js```, to retrieve/store/delete an authorization token from [AsyncStorage](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/docs/usage/). Instantiated the class and gave the entire application access to it through React context ([dependency injection](https://blog.logrocket.com/dependency-injection-react/)). It is simultaneously used to include the token in the authorization headers of subsequent requests to the server (implementation can be found in ```utils/apolloClient.js```).

Added some component tests found in ```components/RepositoryListContainer.test.jsx``` and ```components/SignIn.test.jsx```. To improve testability we refactored the components into container components to reduce dependencies and side effects.

Finally, implemented Infinite scrolling of the MyReviews view and RepositoryList view using [Cursor-based pagination](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm) that the server already facilitates. This can be found in files ```hooks/useRepositories.js```, ```utils/apolloClient.js``` and ```components/RepositoryList/index.jsx```
